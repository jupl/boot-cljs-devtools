* boot-cljs-devtools
** About
[[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][Boot]] task introducing enhancements to CLJS development in Chrome, specifically [[https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools][CLJS DevTools]] and [[https://github.com/binaryage/dirac][Dirac]].
** Installation
Add the following to your =build.boot= dependencies.
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[binaryage/devtools      "0.6.1" :scope "test"]
[binaryage/dirac         "0.2.0" :scope "test"]
[jupl/boot-cljs-devtools "0.1.0" :scope "test"]
#+END_SRC
In addition require the task, specifically =cljs-devtools=.
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[jupl.boot-cljs-devtools :refer [cljs-devtools])
#+END_SRC
Currently files may be generated in the =out= directory, so it would be advisable to add that to someplace like in a =.gitignore=.
** Usage
Ensure that this task runs before the =cljs= and after the =watch= task. Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(deftask dev []
  (comp (watch) (cljs-devtools) (cljs)))
#+END_SRC
For more information on the tools please visit [[https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools][CLJS DevTools]] and [[https://github.com/binaryage/dirac][Dirac]].
