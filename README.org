* boot-cljs-devtools
** About
[[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][Boot]] task introducing enhancements to CLJS development in Chrome, specifically [[https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools][CLJS DevTools]] and [[https://github.com/binaryage/dirac][Dirac]].
** Installation
Latest version:

[[https://clojars.org/jupl/boot-cljs-devtools][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/powerlaces/boot-cljs-devtools.svg]]

In order to install it, add the following to your =build.boot= dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[binaryage/devtools      "0.7.2" :scope "test"]
[binaryage/dirac         "0.6.2" :scope "test"]
[jupl/boot-cljs-devtools "0.X.X" :scope "test"]
#+END_SRC
In addition require the task, specifically =cljs-devtools=.
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[jupl.boot-cljs-devtools :refer [cljs-devtools])
#+END_SRC
Currently files may be generated in the =out= directory, so it would be advisable to add that to someplace like in a =.gitignore=.
** Usage
Ensure that this task runs before the =cljs= and after the =watch= task and that you include a =.cljs.edn= file according to [[https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs/wiki/Usage#multiple-builds][this]].
Task example:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(deftask dev []
  (comp (watch) (cljs-devtools) (cljs)))
#+END_SRC
File =your-ns.cljs.edn= example:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:require  [your-ns.core]
 :init-fns [your-ns.core/init]}
#+END_SRC
